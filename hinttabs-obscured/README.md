Copy and paste the entirety of hinttabs.js into the Tridactyl command line to create a command, `:hinttabs`

`:hinttabs` will list the tabs in the current window

`:hinttabs -a` will list tabs for all windows

a tab can then be selected and switched to using Tridactyl's hinting


to bind one or both of these to a key sequence, use the `:bind` command:

`:bind [key(s)] hinttabs`

or

`:bind [key(s)] hinttabs -a`
